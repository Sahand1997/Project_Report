This project aims to conduct a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML) algorithms, specifically examining their applications, advantages, and disadvantages in the field of geotechnical engineering. The review is designed for civil engineers who already possess a basic understanding of ML but may struggle to select the most appropriate algorithm for their specific research or professional projects. By detailing the key features of prominent ML models and offering practical insights into their strengths and limitations, this project seeks to bridge the knowledge gap and improve decision-making capabilities for civil engineers working with ML in various subfields of it including geotechnical engineering.
This project responds to a significant challenge faced by many engineers: the complexity of choosing the right ML method for their needs. While experts in data science and computer science are well-versed in a wide range of algorithms, engineers often lack the nuanced understanding required to apply these models effectively in engineering contexts. Current solutions, such as existing literature or technical resources, tend to be overly specialized or inaccessible to those outside of data science disciplines. This review will present the algorithms in a more approachable and context-specific way, highlighting real-world engineering applications to ensure greater relevance and usability.

## 2. Introduction

In recent years, the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques into geotechnical engineering has significantly transformed traditional practices, offering innovative solutions to complex problems. The increasing availability of extensive datasets in geotechnical fields has paved the way for the adoption of ML approaches, enabling more accurate predictions and efficient analyses (Shao et al., 2023). 
ML algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and decision trees (DT), have been effectively applied to a variety of geotechnical challenges. These include soil classification, rock type identification, landslide susceptibility assessment, and prediction of geotechnical material properties (Shao et al., 2023). 
The evolution of artificial intelligence has further enhanced the application of ML methods in geotechnical engineering, extending their use from planning and design to construction phases. This progression has led to the development of more robust solutions to geotechnical problems, addressing the inherent complexities of geological bodies and the multifaceted nature of geotechnical issues (W. Zhang et al., 2023). 
ML techniques have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting various geotechnical parameters essential for design and analysis. For instance, they have been employed to estimate soil compaction parameters, such as maximum dry density and optimum moisture content, which are crucial for ensuring the stability and integrity of structures like earth dams and embankments (W. Zhang et al., 2023). 
Additionally, ML models have been utilized to predict the undrained shear strength of sensitive clays, aiding in the assessment of foundation stability. They have also been applied to forecast soil settlement, rock compressive strength, and slope stability, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of geotechnical structures (Phoon & Zhang, 2023). 
Despite these advancements, selecting the most appropriate ML algorithm for specific geotechnical applications remains a challenge. The performance of different algorithms can vary significantly depending on the particular problem and dataset characteristics. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of various ML techniques and their suitability for distinct geotechnical tasks is essential for civil engineers aiming to implement these methods effectively (Reddy, 2017). 
This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by providing a detailed review of prominent ML algorithms and their applications in geotechnical engineering. By examining the advantages and limitations of each method, the report seeks to equip civil engineers with the insights necessary to make informed decisions when selecting and applying ML techniques in their projects.


## 3. Review of Research on Using ML in Geotechnical Engineering 

The use of ML in geotechnical engineering has expanded significantly, offering advanced predictive capabilities that enhance traditional analysis and decision-making processes. ML algorithms have proven adept at handling the complex and nonlinear relationships inherent in geotechnical data, enabling engineers to model and predict a wide range of parameters with greater accuracy and efficiency.
In geotechnical applications, ML can predict both binary variables and numerical variables that are crucial for various engineering tasks. Binary predictions often involve classification problems, such as determining the stability of a slope (stable/unstable) or assessing the likelihood of a landslide occurring. Numerical predictions, on the other hand, encompass continuous variables critical for design and analysis, such as permeability, shear strength, compressibility factors, and settlement behavior. These predictions are vital for designing safe and efficient foundations, slopes, and other geotechnical structures.
ML's ability to incorporate diverse datasets—ranging from soil properties and rock mechanics to environmental conditions and structural loads—has enabled advancements in predicting these parameters. For instance, models like ANN, SVM, and random forests have been applied to analyze complex interactions between input variables and produce reliable results. These applications reduce the reliance on extensive laboratory testing and provide more time-efficient solutions for practical engineering problems.
This section serves as an overview of how ML is utilized to predict various parameters in geotechnical engineering. The following subsections will focus on individual parameters, such as permeability, shear strength, and slope stability, providing a detailed exploration of ML's role in predicting each and its practical implications for the field.


## 3.1. ML Approaches to Soil Permeability Prediction

Soil permeability, which measures the ability of soil to transmit water, is a fundamental parameter in geotechnical engineering. It plays a critical role in a variety of applications, including groundwater flow modeling, slope stability analysis, and the design of drainage and filtration systems. Accurate estimation of soil permeability is essential for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of engineering projects, particularly in water resource management and environmental protection (Elhakim, 2016).
Traditionally, soil permeability is determined through laboratory tests, such as the constant head test for cohesive soils (ASTM D2434) and the falling head test for granular soils (ASTM D2435), as well as field measurements like pump tests. While these methods provide reliable results, they are often time-consuming, expensive, and logistically challenging, especially for large-scale projects or sites that are remote or difficult to access. Such constraints have driven the development and adoption of alternative methods that can provide accurate predictions with greater efficiency.
ML models have emerged as a promising solution for predicting soil permeability based on readily available soil properties. By leveraging input features such as grain size distribution, void ratio, Atterberg limits, plasticity index, and soil density, ML models can analyze complex relationships between these parameters to estimate permeability with high accuracy. This approach reduces the reliance on extensive physical testing, saving both time and resources while maintaining precision.
One significant aspect of ML applications in this field is the heterogeneous nature of soil types, which greatly influences model performance. The permeability behavior of fine-grained soils differs substantially from that of coarse-grained soils due to variations in particle size, structure, and pore connectivity. Fine-grained soils typically exhibit lower permeability and are more sensitive to changes in moisture content and compaction, while coarse-grained soils tend to have higher permeability and exhibit more predictable flow behavior.
Given these differences, researchers often divide datasets into subsets based on soil particle size or classifications, such as fine-grained and coarse-grained soils, to improve the accuracy and reliability of ML models. By training models on datasets that are more homogeneous in terms of soil type, the algorithms can better capture the unique characteristics of each group, leading to more precise predictions. This approach also allows for tailored model selection and parameter tuning, as the optimal ML algorithm for fine-grained soils may differ from that for coarse-grained soils.
In recent studies, advanced ML algorithms such as random forests, SVM, and ANN have shown remarkable success in predicting soil permeability. These models not only account for nonlinear relationships but also adapt to variations in the input data, making them well-suited for geotechnical applications. Moreover, feature selection techniques are often applied to identify the most influential parameters, further enhancing model interpretability and reducing computational complexity. Many researchers have studied the application of ML in predicting the permeability of soil (see table 1).  
Ganjidoost et al. (2016) introduced a hybrid Genetic Algorithm Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (GA-ANFIS) to predict soil permeability coefficients (SPC) across fine-grained, mixed, and granular soils. The study utilized a dataset of 610 samples, with 338 fine-grained, 178 mixed, and 94 granular soils, to develop tailored models for each soil type. Genetic algorithms were employed to optimize the subtractive clustering parameters that define the fuzzy rule base in the ANFIS framework, while a hybrid gradient descent and least squares algorithm was used for model training. This combination allowed the models to effectively handle the nonlinear relationships inherent in soil permeability predictions. The dataset was divided into 80% training and 20% testing sets using Fuzzy C-Means clustering to ensure uniform data distribution and preserve statistical similarities between the subsets. The GA-ANFIS models demonstrated superior performance compared to ANN and modified empirical equations in both prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities. The results highlighted the need for soil-specific models and the effectiveness of combining optimization and soft computing techniques to address the challenges of SPC prediction, particularly for heterogeneous soil types.
Sinha & Wang (2008) developed ANN models to predict permeability coefficients alongside maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC) of soils. The study used a database derived from compaction and permeability tests on 55 soil blends prepared with bentonite, limestone dust, sand, and gravel. They trained separate ANN models for permeability and compaction properties, using features such as grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, and void ratios as inputs. The dataset was split into 90% for training and 10% for testing, with an additional 10% of the training set allocated for validation during network calibration. The study compared ANN models against traditional statistical methods and found that ANNs produced predictions within a 95% confidence interval. Their findings also highlighted the ANN's superior ability to adapt and generalize, making it a reliable tool for estimating permeability coefficients under varying soil compositions and compaction conditions. This research demonstrates the efficacy of ANNs in simplifying the traditionally labor-intensive process of soil property prediction.
Bui et al. (2022) proposed a hybrid Teaching Learning-Based Optimization-Artificial Neural Network (TLBO-ANN) model to predict the soil permeability coefficient (k-value). The study utilized a dataset of 84 soil samples from the Da Nang-Quang Ngai expressway project in Vietnam. Input parameters included natural water content, void ratio, specific gravity, liquid limit, plastic limit, and clay content. The dataset was normalized and split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The TLBO algorithm was employed to optimize the ANN, improving its convergence speed and accuracy. Statistical validation metrics, including correlation coefficient (R = 0.905), RMSE, and MAE, confirmed the model's superior predictive performance compared to existing methods. The authors emphasized that the hybrid approach effectively combines the strengths of TLBO and ANN, offering a robust solution for k-value prediction with minimal computational effort.
R. Zhang & Zhang, (2024) investigated the prediction of soil permeability coefficients using gene expression programming (GEP), comparing it with random forest (RF), group method of data handling (GMDH), and eight empirical models. They compiled a dataset of 81 samples using parameters such as effective size (d10), mean grain size (d50), particle diameters at 60% cumulative content (d60), and void ratio (e). The GEP model exhibited high accuracy (R² = 0.937) and outperformed empirical models, demonstrating the significant influence of particle size and void ratio on permeability. Sensitivity and SHAP analyses ranked d10 as the most impactful feature, followed by d50 and e, while d60 had negligible effects. The study underscores GEP's ability to provide explicit predictive equations suitable for engineering applications, such as seepage analysis and pollutant transport in soils, enhancing its relevance for integrating ML in geotechnical engineering.
Ahmad et al. (2022) applied Gaussian process regression (GPR) to estimate the soil permeability coefficient using six input parameters: liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), clay content (CC), void ratio (e), natural water content (w), and specific density (γ). They developed and compared GPR models with different kernel functions—Pearson universal kernel (PUK), radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial kernel (Poly). The dataset, consisting of 84 soil samples from the Da Nang–Quang Ngai project in Vietnam, was divided into 70% training and 30% testing subsets. The GPR-PUK model outperformed others with an R² of 0.951, showcasing its superior predictive accuracy. Sensitivity analysis indicated that natural water content (w) and void ratio (e) were the most significant predictors, while specific density (γ) was the least influential. Comparisons with ANN, SVM, RF, and M5P models revealed GPR-PUK's superior performance, highlighting its potential in geotechnical applications. This study emphasizes the efficacy of GPR models in achieving high precision with limited data and underscores the importance of appropriate kernel function selection in ML modeling.
Tan et al. (2023) explored the use of ML models to predict the hydraulic conductivity of compacted soil barriers used in landfill liners and covers. Their study utilized a database of 329 records, comprising 12 impact factors, including void ratio, fines content, specific gravity, and degree of saturation after compaction. The authors employed three ML algorithms—Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Neural Network (NNW)—and compared them with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).
The RF model demonstrated superior accuracy, achieving 93% of predictions within a 10-fold difference from measured values. Sensitivity analysis identified void ratio, fines content, and specific gravity as the most influential factors. To enhance usability, the authors developed simplified models requiring fewer input variables without significantly compromising predictive accuracy. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ML in streamlining soil evaluation processes for landfill applications, emphasizing data-driven feature selection and validation.
B. Singh et al. (2021) investigated the permeability of soil using support vector machines (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GP), random forest (RF), and multi-linear regression (MLR). They utilized 95 datasets, with inputs including percentages of sand and fly ash, specific gravity, time, and water head, and found that the Pearson VII kernel function-based SVM achieved the highest accuracy (R = 0.97, NSE = 0.94). Sensitivity analysis revealed that time and water head significantly influenced predictions. The study highlights the efficacy of ML techniques, particularly SVM, for reliable estimation of soil permeability, underscoring the importance of kernel function selection in modeling.
Li et al. (2022) developed a soil database for Singapore that integrates predictions of soil permeability using ML techniques, particularly Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The study highlights the importance of variables such as plasticity, grain size distribution, and spatial location in predicting permeability. A key finding was that the logarithmic transformation of permeability values enhanced model accuracy, with RF outperforming ANN, likely due to limited data availability. This work emphasizes the critical role of ML in creating geotechnical databases for applications such as regional water balance and slope stability analysis.
V. K. Singh et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive study on soil permeability prediction by leveraging five non-wavelet and five wavelet-enhanced machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF). The study employed a dataset comprising sand, silt, clay, organic content (OC), bulk density (BD), and particle density (PD) to develop the models, with the wavelet-transformed RF (W-RF) model achieving the highest accuracy. Statistical evaluations during training and testing phases showed that W-RF outperformed other models, with values such as NSE = 0.900 and RMSE = 1.53 cm/hr. Sensitivity analysis revealed that soil texture parameters (clay, silt, and sand) were the most influential factors in permeability prediction, ranking ahead of OC, BD, and PD. The study highlights the efficacy of wavelet-enhanced ML approaches in accurately predicting soil permeability, emphasizing their potential applications in geotechnical projects such as groundwater management and structural design.
