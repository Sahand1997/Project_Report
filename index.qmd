## 2. Introduction

In recent years, the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques into geotechnical engineering has significantly transformed traditional practices, offering innovative solutions to complex problems. The increasing availability of extensive datasets in geotechnical fields has paved the way for the adoption of ML approaches, enabling more accurate predictions and efficient analyses (Shao et al., 2023). 
ML algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and decision trees (DT), have been effectively applied to a variety of geotechnical challenges. These include soil classification, rock type identification, landslide susceptibility assessment, and prediction of geotechnical material properties (Shao et al., 2023). 
The evolution of artificial intelligence has further enhanced the application of ML methods in geotechnical engineering, extending their use from planning and design to construction phases. This progression has led to the development of more robust solutions to geotechnical problems, addressing the inherent complexities of geological bodies and the multifaceted nature of geotechnical issues (W. Zhang et al., 2023). 
ML techniques have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in predicting various geotechnical parameters essential for design and analysis. For instance, they have been employed to estimate soil compaction parameters, such as maximum dry density and optimum moisture content, which are crucial for ensuring the stability and integrity of structures like earth dams and embankments (W. Zhang et al., 2023). 
Additionally, ML models have been utilized to predict the undrained shear strength of sensitive clays, aiding in the assessment of foundation stability. They have also been applied to forecast soil settlement, rock compressive strength, and slope stability, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of geotechnical structures (Phoon & Zhang, 2023). 
Despite these advancements, selecting the most appropriate ML algorithm for specific geotechnical applications remains a challenge. The performance of different algorithms can vary significantly depending on the particular problem and dataset characteristics. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of various ML techniques and their suitability for distinct geotechnical tasks is essential for civil engineers aiming to implement these methods effectively (Reddy, 2017). 
This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by providing a detailed review of prominent ML algorithms and their applications in geotechnical engineering. By examining the advantages and limitations of each method, the report seeks to equip civil engineers with the insights necessary to make informed decisions when selecting and applying ML techniques in their projects.


## 3. Review of Research on Using ML in Geotechnical Engineering 

The use of ML in geotechnical engineering has expanded significantly, offering advanced predictive capabilities that enhance traditional analysis and decision-making processes. ML algorithms have proven adept at handling the complex and nonlinear relationships inherent in geotechnical data, enabling engineers to model and predict a wide range of parameters with greater accuracy and efficiency.
In geotechnical applications, ML can predict both binary variables and numerical variables that are crucial for various engineering tasks. Binary predictions often involve classification problems, such as determining the stability of a slope (stable/unstable) or assessing the likelihood of a landslide occurring. Numerical predictions, on the other hand, encompass continuous variables critical for design and analysis, such as permeability, shear strength, compressibility factors, and settlement behavior. These predictions are vital for designing safe and efficient foundations, slopes, and other geotechnical structures.
ML's ability to incorporate diverse datasets—ranging from soil properties and rock mechanics to environmental conditions and structural loads—has enabled advancements in predicting these parameters. For instance, models like ANN, SVM, and random forests have been applied to analyze complex interactions between input variables and produce reliable results. These applications reduce the reliance on extensive laboratory testing and provide more time-efficient solutions for practical engineering problems.
This section serves as an overview of how ML is utilized to predict various parameters in geotechnical engineering. The following subsections will focus on individual parameters, such as permeability, shear strength, and slope stability, providing a detailed exploration of ML's role in predicting each and its practical implications for the field.


## 3.1. ML Approaches to Soil Permeability Prediction

Soil permeability, which measures the ability of soil to transmit water, is a fundamental parameter in geotechnical engineering. It plays a critical role in a variety of applications, including groundwater flow modeling, slope stability analysis, and the design of drainage and filtration systems. Accurate estimation of soil permeability is essential for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of engineering projects, particularly in water resource management and environmental protection (Elhakim, 2016).
Traditionally, soil permeability is determined through laboratory tests, such as the constant head test for cohesive soils (ASTM D2434) and the falling head test for granular soils (ASTM D2435), as well as field measurements like pump tests. While these methods provide reliable results, they are often time-consuming, expensive, and logistically challenging, especially for large-scale projects or sites that are remote or difficult to access. Such constraints have driven the development and adoption of alternative methods that can provide accurate predictions with greater efficiency.
ML models have emerged as a promising solution for predicting soil permeability based on readily available soil properties. By leveraging input features such as grain size distribution, void ratio, Atterberg limits, plasticity index, and soil density, ML models can analyze complex relationships between these parameters to estimate permeability with high accuracy. This approach reduces the reliance on extensive physical testing, saving both time and resources while maintaining precision.
One significant aspect of ML applications in this field is the heterogeneous nature of soil types, which greatly influences model performance. The permeability behavior of fine-grained soils differs substantially from that of coarse-grained soils due to variations in particle size, structure, and pore connectivity. Fine-grained soils typically exhibit lower permeability and are more sensitive to changes in moisture content and compaction, while coarse-grained soils tend to have higher permeability and exhibit more predictable flow behavior.
Given these differences, researchers often divide datasets into subsets based on soil particle size or classifications, such as fine-grained and coarse-grained soils, to improve the accuracy and reliability of ML models. By training models on datasets that are more homogeneous in terms of soil type, the algorithms can better capture the unique characteristics of each group, leading to more precise predictions. This approach also allows for tailored model selection and parameter tuning, as the optimal ML algorithm for fine-grained soils may differ from that for coarse-grained soils.
In recent studies, advanced ML algorithms such as random forests, SVM, and ANN have shown remarkable success in predicting soil permeability. These models not only account for nonlinear relationships but also adapt to variations in the input data, making them well-suited for geotechnical applications. Moreover, feature selection techniques are often applied to identify the most influential parameters, further enhancing model interpretability and reducing computational complexity. Many researchers have studied the application of ML in predicting the permeability of soil (see table 1).  
Ganjidoost et al. (2016) introduced a hybrid Genetic Algorithm Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (GA-ANFIS) to predict soil permeability coefficients (SPC) across fine-grained, mixed, and granular soils. The study utilized a dataset of 610 samples, with 338 fine-grained, 178 mixed, and 94 granular soils, to develop tailored models for each soil type. Genetic algorithms were employed to optimize the subtractive clustering parameters that define the fuzzy rule base in the ANFIS framework, while a hybrid gradient descent and least squares algorithm was used for model training. This combination allowed the models to effectively handle the nonlinear relationships inherent in soil permeability predictions. The dataset was divided into 80% training and 20% testing sets using Fuzzy C-Means clustering to ensure uniform data distribution and preserve statistical similarities between the subsets. The GA-ANFIS models demonstrated superior performance compared to ANN and modified empirical equations in both prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities. The results highlighted the need for soil-specific models and the effectiveness of combining optimization and soft computing techniques to address the challenges of SPC prediction, particularly for heterogeneous soil types.
Sinha & Wang (2008) developed ANN models to predict permeability coefficients alongside maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC) of soils. The study used a database derived from compaction and permeability tests on 55 soil blends prepared with bentonite, limestone dust, sand, and gravel. They trained separate ANN models for permeability and compaction properties, using features such as grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, and void ratios as inputs. The dataset was split into 90% for training and 10% for testing, with an additional 10% of the training set allocated for validation during network calibration. The study compared ANN models against traditional statistical methods and found that ANNs produced predictions within a 95% confidence interval. Their findings also highlighted the ANN's superior ability to adapt and generalize, making it a reliable tool for estimating permeability coefficients under varying soil compositions and compaction conditions. This research demonstrates the efficacy of ANNs in simplifying the traditionally labor-intensive process of soil property prediction.
Bui et al. (2022) proposed a hybrid Teaching Learning-Based Optimization-Artificial Neural Network (TLBO-ANN) model to predict the soil permeability coefficient (k-value). The study utilized a dataset of 84 soil samples from the Da Nang-Quang Ngai expressway project in Vietnam. Input parameters included natural water content, void ratio, specific gravity, liquid limit, plastic limit, and clay content. The dataset was normalized and split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The TLBO algorithm was employed to optimize the ANN, improving its convergence speed and accuracy. Statistical validation metrics, including correlation coefficient (R = 0.905), RMSE, and MAE, confirmed the model's superior predictive performance compared to existing methods. The authors emphasized that the hybrid approach effectively combines the strengths of TLBO and ANN, offering a robust solution for k-value prediction with minimal computational effort.
R. Zhang & Zhang, (2024) investigated the prediction of soil permeability coefficients using gene expression programming (GEP), comparing it with random forest (RF), group method of data handling (GMDH), and eight empirical models. They compiled a dataset of 81 samples using parameters such as effective size (d10), mean grain size (d50), particle diameters at 60% cumulative content (d60), and void ratio (e). The GEP model exhibited high accuracy (R² = 0.937) and outperformed empirical models, demonstrating the significant influence of particle size and void ratio on permeability. Sensitivity and SHAP analyses ranked d10 as the most impactful feature, followed by d50 and e, while d60 had negligible effects. The study underscores GEP's ability to provide explicit predictive equations suitable for engineering applications, such as seepage analysis and pollutant transport in soils, enhancing its relevance for integrating ML in geotechnical engineering.
Ahmad et al. (2022) applied Gaussian process regression (GPR) to estimate the soil permeability coefficient using six input parameters: liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), clay content (CC), void ratio (e), natural water content (w), and specific density (γ). They developed and compared GPR models with different kernel functions—Pearson universal kernel (PUK), radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial kernel (Poly). The dataset, consisting of 84 soil samples from the Da Nang–Quang Ngai project in Vietnam, was divided into 70% training and 30% testing subsets. The GPR-PUK model outperformed others with an R² of 0.951, showcasing its superior predictive accuracy. Sensitivity analysis indicated that natural water content (w) and void ratio (e) were the most significant predictors, while specific density (γ) was the least influential. Comparisons with ANN, SVM, RF, and M5P models revealed GPR-PUK's superior performance, highlighting its potential in geotechnical applications. This study emphasizes the efficacy of GPR models in achieving high precision with limited data and underscores the importance of appropriate kernel function selection in ML modeling.
Tan et al. (2023) explored the use of ML models to predict the hydraulic conductivity of compacted soil barriers used in landfill liners and covers. Their study utilized a database of 329 records, comprising 12 impact factors, including void ratio, fines content, specific gravity, and degree of saturation after compaction. The authors employed three ML algorithms—Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Neural Network (NNW)—and compared them with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).
The RF model demonstrated superior accuracy, achieving 93% of predictions within a 10-fold difference from measured values. Sensitivity analysis identified void ratio, fines content, and specific gravity as the most influential factors. To enhance usability, the authors developed simplified models requiring fewer input variables without significantly compromising predictive accuracy. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ML in streamlining soil evaluation processes for landfill applications, emphasizing data-driven feature selection and validation.
B. Singh et al. (2021) investigated the permeability of soil using support vector machines (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GP), random forest (RF), and multi-linear regression (MLR). They utilized 95 datasets, with inputs including percentages of sand and fly ash, specific gravity, time, and water head, and found that the Pearson VII kernel function-based SVM achieved the highest accuracy (R = 0.97, NSE = 0.94). Sensitivity analysis revealed that time and water head significantly influenced predictions. The study highlights the efficacy of ML techniques, particularly SVM, for reliable estimation of soil permeability, underscoring the importance of kernel function selection in modeling.
Li et al. (2022) developed a soil database for Singapore that integrates predictions of soil permeability using ML techniques, particularly Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The study highlights the importance of variables such as plasticity, grain size distribution, and spatial location in predicting permeability. A key finding was that the logarithmic transformation of permeability values enhanced model accuracy, with RF outperforming ANN, likely due to limited data availability. This work emphasizes the critical role of ML in creating geotechnical databases for applications such as regional water balance and slope stability analysis.
V. K. Singh et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive study on soil permeability prediction by leveraging five non-wavelet and five wavelet-enhanced machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF). The study employed a dataset comprising sand, silt, clay, organic content (OC), bulk density (BD), and particle density (PD) to develop the models, with the wavelet-transformed RF (W-RF) model achieving the highest accuracy. Statistical evaluations during training and testing phases showed that W-RF outperformed other models, with values such as NSE = 0.900 and RMSE = 1.53 cm/hr. Sensitivity analysis revealed that soil texture parameters (clay, silt, and sand) were the most influential factors in permeability prediction, ranking ahead of OC, BD, and PD. The study highlights the efficacy of wavelet-enhanced ML approaches in accurately predicting soil permeability, emphasizing their potential applications in geotechnical projects such as groundwater management and structural design.

## 3.2. ML Approaches to Soil Shear Strength Prediction

Shear strength is a fundamental parameter in geotechnical engineering that defines the maximum resistance of soil to shear stress before failure occurs. It plays a critical role in the stability analysis of slopes, the design of retaining walls, foundations, and embankments, as well as in understanding soil-structure interactions (Stefanow & Dudziński, 2021). The shear strength of soil is primarily influenced by factors such as cohesion, internal friction angle, density, and moisture content, and it is typically determined through laboratory tests, including the direct shear test (ASTM D3080), triaxial compression test (ASTM D4767), and unconfined compression test (ASTM D2166).
Soil shear strength is categorized into drained shear strength and undrained shear strength, depending on whether pore water pressure is allowed to dissipate during loading. Drained shear strength is evaluated under conditions where water in the soil pores has sufficient time to escape, making it applicable to scenarios involving long-term loading. It is controlled by the effective stress in the soil and is particularly relevant for coarse-grained soils like sands and gravels. In contrast, undrained shear strength represents the soil's resistance under rapid loading conditions, where pore water pressure does not have time to equalize. This parameter is vital in analyzing fine-grained soils such as clays and silts, which exhibit distinct behavior due to their lower permeability. Both drained and undrained conditions must be considered to fully assess soil behavior under varying loading and drainage conditions.
While these conventional methods provide reliable results, they are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and may require specialized equipment and controlled conditions, making them impractical for rapid or large-scale assessments. Additionally, the heterogeneity of natural soils and the influence of varying environmental conditions can pose challenges to accurately predicting shear strength through traditional means. To overcome these limitations, ML models have emerged as an effective alternative for predicting soil shear strength. By leveraging easily measurable soil properties, such as grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, and bulk density, ML models can provide fast and accurate predictions, enabling efficient decision-making in geotechnical design and risk assessment. These models are particularly advantageous in scenarios where rapid assessments are required, such as during emergency slope stability evaluations or in large-scale infrastructure projects. In this regard, many researchers have studied the application of ML in predicting the permeability of soil (see table 2).  
Nguyen et al. (2021) examined the influence of data splitting on the performance of machine learning (ML) models in predicting the shear strength of soil. They utilized a dataset of 538 soil samples from the Long Phu 1 power plant project in Vietnam, with input variables including clay content, void ratio, moisture content, liquid limit, plastic limit, and specific gravity. The undrained and unconsolidated (UU) shear strength values determined via direct shear tests were used as output variables. Three ML techniques—ANN, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Boosting Trees—were applied and evaluated under various training-to-testing ratios (10/90, 20/80, ..., 90/10). Statistical metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Correlation Coefficient (R) were used to assess the models. Monte Carlo simulations with 1,000 iterations were conducted to account for random sampling effects. The results revealed that ANN outperformed ELM and Boosted Trees, achieving the lowest errors and highest stability (Mean R = 0.9348). The 70/30 split ratio was identified as the optimal configuration for ML modeling. This study highlights the significance of data splitting strategies and model selection in enhancing prediction accuracy. By demonstrating the robustness of ANN in predicting soil shear strength, it underscores the practical applicability of ML in geotechnical engineering, particularly for efficient design and construction of infrastructure projects.
Demir & Sahin (2024) investigated the prediction of undrained shear strength (UDSS) of cohesive soils using a novel ML framework combined with advanced data preprocessing techniques. The study utilized a dataset of 384 samples comprising six input features: depth, liquid limit, plastic limit, natural water content, vertical effective stress, and preconsolidation stress. Four ML models—Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Cubist, and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB)—were developed and systematically assessed under different data scaling and transformation methods, including Box-Cox, Log, Yeo-Johnson, Z-Score, and Range normalization. The findings revealed that the Cubist model paired with Box-Cox transformation achieved the best prediction accuracy (R² = 0.87, RMSE = 3.38) when trained on 90% of the dataset. The results highlighted the importance of data preprocessing, with transformation-based methods outperforming scaling-based methods. The study also demonstrated that increasing the training set size generally enhanced model performance. This comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of combining sophisticated ML algorithms with appropriate preprocessing techniques to improve the accuracy of geotechnical predictions, particularly for soil shear strength, where conventional methods may be limited by cost and time constraints.
W. Zhang et al. (2021) utilized Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) models with Bayesian optimization to predict the undrained shear strength (USS) of soft clays. Drawing on 384 samples from the TC304 database, they employed input features including preconsolidation stress (PS), vertical effective stress (VES), liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), and natural water content (W). Bayesian optimization was used to fine-tune hyperparameters, and 5-fold cross-validation ensured robust model assessment. The XGBoost model outperformed other ML models, achieving the highest accuracy with an R² of 0.92 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.4 kPa for testing data. Sensitivity analysis revealed PS as the most critical predictor, followed by VES and PL, while LL and W were less influential. The ensemble models, particularly XGBoost, demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional transformation models, offering improved prediction accuracy for multi-source and noisy data. This study highlights the potential of ensemble learning methods in geotechnical engineering, providing a more efficient and accurate approach to predict USS for applications in slope stability, foundation design, and other soil-structure interactions. The inclusion of feature importance metrics further enhances the interpretability and practical applicability of the models.
P. Zhang et al. (2022) proposed a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) framework to model soil properties, specifically focusing on undrained shear strength (USS) of clays, incorporating uncertainty quantification. They utilized a dataset of 353 samples with six input parameters, including water content (w), vertical stress (σv), liquid limit (LL), plasticity index (PI), over consolidation ratio (OCR), and sensitivity ratio (St). BNN was applied with two approaches: Variational Inference (VI) and Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), and their performances were compared against conventional ANN. The results demonstrated that while BNN models sacrificed slight accuracy compared to ANN, they provided superior interpretability and reliable uncertainty evaluation. Among the BNN approaches, the MCD-based model exhibited lower prediction errors and more stable uncertainty estimates, making it suitable for practical applications. Sensitivity analysis revealed that vertical stress and OCR had the most significant influence on USS, with high correlations captured effectively by the BNN framework. The study highlighted the capability of BNN to address the variability and incomplete nature of geotechnical datasets, offering a robust and interpretable tool for predicting USS in complex engineering scenarios.
Tien Bui et al. (2019) developed a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) model integrating Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) with Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO) to predict the shear strength of soil. The study used a dataset of 332 samples from the Trung Luong National Expressway Project in Vietnam, with eleven input features, including sample depth, sand, loam, and clay percentages, moisture content, wet density, specific gravity, liquid limit, plastic limit, plastic index, and liquid index. The LSSVM component of the model generalized the relationship between input variables and shear strength, while CSO optimized the hyperparameters of LSSVM. The hybrid model (LSSVM-CSO) outperformed standard LSSVM, Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN), and Regression Tree (RT) models, achieving superior accuracy with an R² of 0.885 and RMSE of 0.082. The study demonstrated the model's ability to handle nonlinear and multivariate relationships effectively, with CSO ensuring the optimal parameter configuration. Sensitivity analysis underscored the importance of variables such as clay content, plastic index, and moisture content in predicting soil shear strength. This research highlights the potential of combining advanced ML algorithms with metaheuristic optimization techniques for geotechnical applications, providing a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional laboratory-based shear strength estimation methods. The proposed model's robustness and automation capabilities make it a practical tool for large-scale infrastructure projects.
Niyogi et al. (2023) applied ML models, including SVM, Random Forest (RF), and DNN, to predict the shear strength of lateritic soils. The study utilized a dataset of 102 soil samples collected from India, with input features including unit weight, maximum dry density, liquid limit, plasticity index, and optimum moisture content. Laboratory tests such as direct shear, Proctor compaction, and Atterberg limit tests were conducted to derive the dataset. Among the models, the DNN achieved the highest accuracy, with R² = 0.99 and RMSE = 1.20 for the testing dataset, surpassing SVM and RF in prediction performance. Sensitivity analysis revealed that optimum moisture content was the most influential factor, followed by plasticity index and unit weight. The study emphasized the advantage of DNN in handling complex non-linear relationships and highlighted its potential as a superior alternative to traditional empirical and regression-based methods. This research provides valuable insights into the application of ML for efficient, accurate, and cost-effective prediction of geotechnical parameters in lateritic soils.
Rabbani et al. (2023) investigated the prediction of soil shear strength using five ensemble learning models: RF, Extra Trees Regressor (ETR), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), AdaBoost Regressor (ABR), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR). The study utilized a dataset of 249 soil samples collected from boreholes, incorporating twelve input features, including sample depth, sand, loam, clay proportions, water content, bulk density, void ratio, liquid limit, plastic limit, and liquidity index. The models were evaluated using six statistical metrics: R², RMSE, MAE, MSE, RMSLE, and MAPE. Among the models, ETR outperformed others, achieving R² = 0.7934 and RMSE = 0.0378 during validation. Sensitivity analysis highlighted liquidity index, water content, void ratio, and bulk density as the most influential features in predicting SS. The ETR model demonstrated robust predictive capabilities, offering low error rates and high accuracy. This study underscores the advantages of ensemble learning techniques in addressing the nonlinear complexities of SS prediction and highlights their applicability in geotechnical engineering tasks, such as slope stability analysis and foundation design, where efficient and accurate predictions are critical.
Pham et al. (2018) investigated the prediction of shear strength in soft soils using advanced ML models, including Particle Swarm Optimization–Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (PANFIS), Genetic Algorithm–Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (GANFIS), SVR, and ANN. The study utilized 188 plastic clay soil samples from two major bridge construction projects in Vietnam, with input variables such as moisture content, clay content, liquid limit, plastic limit, and plastic index. The PANFIS model outperformed other methods, achieving the highest prediction accuracy (R = 0.601, RMSE = 0.038), followed by GANFIS (R = 0.569, RMSE = 0.04), SVR (R = 0.549, RMSE = 0.044), and ANN (R = 0.49, RMSE = 0.047). The superior performance of PANFIS was attributed to its optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which effectively fine-tuned the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy inference system. The GANFIS model also demonstrated robust results, benefiting from Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based parameter optimization. This study highlights the capability of hybrid ML models in accurately predicting shear strength, offering a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional laboratory testing methods. The results demonstrate the potential for PANFIS and GANFIS to provide practical solutions in geotechnical engineering, particularly in scenarios requiring rapid and reliable predictions of soil properties.

## 3.3. ML Approaches to Slope Stability Prediction

ML has increasingly been utilized to predict slope stability, addressing one of the most critical concerns in geotechnical engineering. Slope stability assessments are traditionally performed using the Factor of Safety (FOS), a parameter that represents the ratio of resisting forces to driving forces along a potential failure surface. Conventional methods for calculating FOS, such as limit equilibrium methods (e.g., Bishop, Janbu, or Morgenstern-Price) or numerical approaches like finite element analysis, are well-established but can be time-intensive, especially for complex slope geometries or conditions involving seismic forces. These limitations have driven the exploration of machine learning models, which offer rapid and often robust predictions by leveraging large datasets.
Research in this area can be categorized based on the prediction objectives of the models. One group of studies focuses on determining whether a slope is stable or unstable, framing the output as a binary classification problem. These models assign a discrete value, typically 1 for stable and 0 for unstable, and are particularly useful for preliminary assessments or risk evaluations where binary outcomes suffice. The second group of studies predicts the Factor of Safety, a continuous measure that provides a detailed quantification of slope stability. These models allow engineers to assess not only whether a slope is likely to fail but also the extent to which it is approaching a failure condition. For FOS prediction, critical factors such as the assumed failure surface, the methods used to calculate failure forces, and the inclusion of additional loads, such as seismic forces, significantly influence the results. Comparative evaluation of these models necessitates careful attention to these methodological details.
Datasets used for training machine learning models in this field come from various sources. Real-world data, often derived from case studies and field observations, provide valuable insights but are limited in scope and variability. Synthetic datasets, generated using advanced simulation software such as GeoStudio or through Monte Carlo methods, enable the exploration of a broader range of slope conditions and incorporate uncertainties in soil properties and external loads. Monte Carlo simulations, in particular, are frequently employed to introduce variability into the dataset, ensuring that models can generalize well to diverse scenarios.
In the literature, some papers evaluate slope stability considering only the self-weight of the slope, while others account for seismic loading, which plays a significant role in regions prone to earthquakes. Seismic forces add dynamic complexities to slope stability and require advanced modeling techniques to simulate their impact accurately. Machine learning models trained with seismic considerations often demonstrate superior predictive capability for dynamic conditions, though the reliance on simulation-based data is typically higher in these cases. 
Gordan et al. (2016) investigated seismic slope stability by employing ANN and a hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization-ANN (PSO–ANN) model to predict the Factor of Safety (FOS) of homogeneous slopes. The study utilized GeoStudio software based on the limit equilibrium method (LEM) to simulate 699 FOS values under varying conditions, including slope height, gradient, cohesion, internal friction angle, and peak ground acceleration (PGA). These parameters were selected as inputs for the predictive models. The study revealed that the PSO–ANN model significantly outperformed the standalone ANN in terms of accuracy and reliability, achieving an R² of 0.986 and an RMSE of 0.022 for testing datasets, compared to R² of 0.915 and RMSE of 0.057 for ANN. The PSO–ANN hybrid approach demonstrated superior capability in avoiding local minima during optimization and provided more consistent results. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the critical influence of slope height and PGA on slope stability under seismic conditions. This research underscores the utility of combining optimization algorithms like PSO with neural networks to enhance predictive accuracy for slope stability, particularly in seismic scenarios. By leveraging simulation-based data and advanced modeling techniques, the study offers a robust alternative to traditional methods, enabling efficient and precise risk assessments for slope design under dynamic loading conditions.
Hoang & Pham (2016) developed a hybrid machine learning model using Least Squares Support Vector Classification (LS-SVC) optimized by the Firefly Algorithm (FA) to assess slope stability. The model utilized a dataset of 168 real-world slope cases collected from multiple countries, featuring six key input parameters: unit weight, soil cohesion, internal friction angle, slope angle, slope height, and pore pressure ratio. The slope condition was classified into stable or unstable (binary output), and the dataset was evenly split into 84 stable and 84 unstable cases for model training and validation. The FA optimization enhanced the LS-SVC by determining optimal hyperparameters, and the model's performance was validated through ten-fold cross-validation. The hybrid approach achieved superior classification accuracy compared to benchmark methods, such as ANN and SVM, demonstrating an average classification accuracy of 91.41% in training and 86.31% in testing. Sensitivity analysis revealed that pore pressure ratio, unit weight, and soil cohesion were the most influential factors in determining slope stability. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining ML classification techniques with metaheuristic optimization for reliable slope stability assessment. The proposed model provides a practical tool for civil engineers to evaluate slope safety efficiently, enabling its use in planning, risk mitigation, and emergency response strategies in slope-prone areas.
Qi & Tang (2018) conducted a comprehensive study comparing six integrated artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for predicting slope stability. These approaches combined ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), with the Firefly Algorithm (FA) for hyperparameter tuning. The dataset comprised 148 slope cases sourced from multinational field data, including parameters such as slope height, angle, cohesion, internal friction angle, unit weight, and pore water ratio. The study demonstrated that the hybrid models significantly enhanced predictive accuracy, with SVM achieving the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.967, followed closely by GBM (0.962) and RF (0.957). Sensitivity analysis identified cohesion as the most critical factor affecting slope stability, followed by internal friction angle and unit weight. The use of FA for hyperparameter optimization allowed models to converge rapidly and achieve high performance with minimal computational overhead. This research emphasizes the effectiveness of integrating metaheuristic algorithms with ML for robust and efficient slope stability prediction. The study provides valuable insights for practical applications in geotechnical engineering, including designing safer slopes and evaluating stability under complex conditions. It also highlights the advantages of combining field data with advanced AI techniques to enhance decision-making processes in slope risk assessment.
Huang et al. (2023) proposed the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for slope stability prediction, comparing its performance to Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The study used data generated from Geo-Studio software, based on the limit equilibrium method, to simulate the Factor of Safety (FOS) for 2,610 soil slopes under various conditions. Key parameters such as slope height, slope angle, cohesion, internal friction angle, and volumetric weight were used as input variables. The dataset comprised 2,160 training samples and 450 testing samples. The LSTM model demonstrated superior performance over traditional ML models, achieving the lowest RMSE (4.45%) and the highest modeling efficiency (EF = 0.9827). This was attributed to LSTM's ability to extract global features and model nonlinear and dynamic relationships effectively. The study highlights LSTM's advantage in handling complex data and its potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of slope stability prediction compared to conventional methods. This research emphasizes the integration of advanced deep learning techniques in geotechnical engineering, offering robust solutions for evaluating FOS. It also underscores the importance of using realistic simulation datasets to enhance the reliability of predictive models in slope stability assessments.
Mustafa et al. (2024) explored the prediction of the Factor of Safety (FOS) for infinite slopes in using ML models. The study developed three ML models: ANN, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and a hybrid ANN model optimized with Particle Swarm Optimization (ANN-PSO). The models were trained on a dataset of 200 synthetic samples generated using Monte Carlo simulations with five input parameters: unit weight, cohesion, angle of shear resistance, slope angle, and slope height. The ANN-PSO model exhibited superior performance, achieving an R2 of 0.931 in training and 0.833 in testing, along with the lowest RMSE values (0.060 in training and 0.073 in testing). Sensitivity analysis revealed cohesion (ccc) as the most influential parameter on FOS, followed by the angle of shear resistance, slope angle, unit weight, and slope height. Reliability analysis using the First-Order Second Moment (FOSM) method confirmed the robustness of the ANN-PSO model, with a reliability index (β\betaβ) closely matching observed values. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining ML with metaheuristic optimization techniques for slope stability analysis. The ANN-PSO model not only provides accurate FOS predictions but also offers a practical alternative to traditional, time-intensive methods, making it particularly suitable for rapid geotechnical evaluations.
Aminpour et al. (2023) presented a novel machine learning-aided Monte Carlo (MLAMC) reliability analysis method to predict slope stability for anisotropic and heterogeneous soils. This study combines traditional Monte Carlo simulations with ML surrogate models to significantly reduce computational time while maintaining high accuracy. The dataset consisted of 120,000 slope stability simulations, incorporating spatially variable soil properties modeled as random fields with log-normal distributions. The input parameters included undrained shear strength, coefficient of variation, and anisotropy ratio, while the outputs were binary classifications of slope stability (stable or failed). The ML surrogate models, including (RF, SVC, and ANN, were trained using only 1–2% of the Monte Carlo dataset. The results demonstrated that ML models could predict the probability of failure with mean errors as low as 0.7% when trained on just 1% of the data, reducing computational time from 306 days for a complete Monte Carlo simulation to 14 hours. SVC and RF outperformed ANN, especially in handling heterogeneous and anisotropic conditions. This research highlights the potential of ML as a computationally efficient alternative for slope stability assessments, particularly in scenarios involving spatially variable soil properties. The proposed MLAMC method enables robust and rapid reliability analyses, making it a valuable tool for geotechnical engineers.
Kang et al. (2016) developed a hybrid probabilistic approach for slope system reliability analysis, integrating Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The study focused on predicting the Factor of Safety (FOS) for slopes by constructing response surfaces that approximate limit state functions based on simulated datasets. Using Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS), the proposed method evaluated slope failure probabilities while addressing system effects arising from multiple failure modes. The LSSVM model was optimized using PSO to select hyperparameters, ensuring efficient and accurate approximations of the FOS. The dataset included synthetic slopes with varying properties, such as cohesion, friction angle, slope height, and loading conditions. The method demonstrated high accuracy, achieving R² values exceeding 0.99 and significantly reducing computational time compared to direct MCS. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the critical role of cohesion and friction angle in determining slope stability. This study underscores the effectiveness of combining ML-based response surface methods with probabilistic simulations for slope stability assessment. By addressing system reliability and incorporating multiple failure scenarios, the proposed methodology offers a practical and computationally efficient alternative to traditional reliability analysis techniques in geotechnical engineering.
