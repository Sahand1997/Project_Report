Using a binomial distribution, we simulate 25 students repeatedly (e.g., 10,000 trials) with a 70% probability of working. For each trial, we calculate the proportion of students working at least 5 hours to create a distribution of sample proportions.\n",

This comparison helps assess whether the observed value aligns with what we’d expect if the true population proportion were 70%.

Alternatively, a formal hypothesis test using the simulation results can determine whether there is evidence to reject the assumption."

It doesn’t imply that Successful ratings lead to lower raises in an absolute sense, only that they are smaller compared to the reference group.
